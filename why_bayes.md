For me, while bayesian stats has appealing philosophy, the value in it is in being able to import more kinds of information beyond linear regression.

Examples include:

* [Integrating differential equations](https://www.magesblog.com/post/2021-02-08-fitting-multivariate-ode-models-with-brms/)
  *  [Modelling for fisheries management](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10556788.2011.597854)
  *  [Epidemiological Modelling](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Bayesian_Epidemiological.pdf)
* [Integrating Prior Information](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html#111_Quantifying_Consequences)
* [Modelling Hierarchical Data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf)
